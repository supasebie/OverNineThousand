It’s August 16, 2025—my birthday—and I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate than by launching our new site and announcing our next big adventure: Psychic Tournament.

This is the beginning of a new chapter. The site will be our home base for updates, deep dives, postmortems, and everything in between. Psychic Tournament is our flagship project: a game about reads and bluffs, timing and tempo—where the real skill is anticipating what your opponent will do next.

## Why we chose today

Birthdays mark the passage of time, but they’re also mile markers—moments to look back at how far we’ve come and to point with intention at where we’re going. Over the past months we’ve been building, learning, and polishing in the open as much as possible. Today we’re putting a stake in the ground and inviting you along for the journey.

## Announcing Psychic Tournament

Psychic Tournament is a competitive, fast-paced experience centered on prediction, mind games, and momentum swings. It’s designed for quick, high-stakes rounds that reward pattern recognition and bold calls. We’re building it with cross‑platform in mind so you can play where you want, when you want.

There’s so much more we’ll share soon—mechanics, art direction, modes, and the tech that powers it—but for now, consider this your formal invitation to the tournament.

## Our Flutter adventures

We chose Flutter for a simple reason: we want great-feeling interfaces that work everywhere without rebuilding the universe each time. The framework’s composable, declarative approach made it natural to iterate quickly on UI/UX, transitions, and interaction layers.

Highlights and lessons from the road so far:

- Widgets all the way down: Embracing composition paid off. Smaller, focused widgets kept complex screens readable and testable.
- Layout literacy: Getting fluent with constraints, intrinsic sizing, and the rendering pipeline made performance tuning and responsive layouts far less mysterious.
- Async with intent: Futures and Streams are powerful—but discipline around lifecycles and cancellation matters. Clear ownership patterns saved us from leaky abstractions.
- Tooling is your friend: DevTools timelines, rebuild stats, and the Inspector helped us spot needless work and keep animations smooth.
- Audio that feels alive: We leaned on flutter_soloud to manage music and sound effects with low latency. Smooth fades, layered ambience, and crisp SFX do a lot of heavy lifting for immersion—and flutter_soloud gave us the control and reliability we needed.

## What you’ll find on the site

- Dev logs and technical write‑ups: from animation pipelines to performance wins (and fails).
- Design notes: systems, balance, and the psychology of reads and information.
- Release updates: playable builds, patch notes, and roadmap checkpoints.
- Behind‑the‑scenes: art drops, iterations, and the stories in the margins.

## What’s next

- A first‑look teaser that sets the vibe and pacing.
- Playable preview builds to gather feedback on feel, clarity, and flow.
- An audio spotlight: how our flutter_soloud setup layers music/SFX to guide player focus.
- Community calls: we’ll be looking for early testers and folks who love tinkering with systems and surfacing edge cases.

## Thank you

If you’ve offered feedback, encouragement, or tough questions—thank you. If you’re new here, welcome. The best part of building in public is getting to share the process, learn out loud, and turn ideas into something people can touch.

## Onward

Today is special. It’s a birthday, a launch day, and a promise: to keep building, keep learning, and make Psychic Tournament something worth your time and mastery.

If you’re excited, here are a few ways to help:

- Subscribe for updates so you don’t miss the first playable builds.
- Tell a friend who loves competitive mind games.
- Share your questions—we’ll fold them into upcoming posts and dev logs.
